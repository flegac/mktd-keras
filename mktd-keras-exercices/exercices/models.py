class Models:
    """
    A Model, in Machine Learning, is a function f: Tensor -> Tensor.
    The interesting fact about Models is that they can be trained to approximate another function.

    Most ML problems can be expressed as "How to approximate a function over Tensors".
    Ex:
        Original problem : "Tell me if a picture represents a cat or a dog"
        Encoded problem :
            - transform a picture into a Tensor of shape (width, height, 3) : the size 3 is for (R,G,B) color components
            - encode the known categories (cat, dog) as a Tensor of shape (2) : cat = [1,0] and dog = [0,1]
            - Give me the function F: (width,height,3) -> (2) that maps images to categories

    Given the reformulation above, the hard part of the problem is to write the F function.

    A Model purpose is exactly to solve this problem by approximating the F function.
    The training process consists in taking a Model (f function) and making it converge toward the F function.

    A Model usually has two function in its API :
        - fit(dataset) : modify the Model internal parameters to fit the target function F,
        - predict(tensor) : compute an approximation of the F function on some input Tensor.
